# 42_Inception
This repository contains the solution for the Inception project as part of the 42 curriculum. The goal of this project is to gain hands-on experience with Docker by building and managing containerized services, specifically setting up a basic LEMP stack (Linux, Nginx, MySQL (MariaDB), and PHP) environment.

## Key Learning Objectives:
- Understand and apply Docker concepts, such as Dockerfiles, containers, volumes, and networks.
- Create a custom LEMP stack using Docker containers.
- Configure each service (Nginx, MySQL, and PHP) to run in its isolated container and work together as a cohesive environment.
- Learn to orchestrate multiple Docker containers to replicate a small-scale server environment.
- Gain experience with service management and basic web server administration.

This project emphasizes the practical use of Docker for modern application deployment, focusing on security, modularity, and scalability.
